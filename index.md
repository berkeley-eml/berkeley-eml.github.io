Welcome to the Econometrics Laboratory (EML) at the University of
California at Berkeley. The Lab is a state-of-the-art and highly
service-oriented computing facility that provides extensive server
services, comprehensive user support, and is committed to provide the best
possible computational hardware and wide selection of statistical,
mathematical and econometric software for its users.

The EML is a computing facility dedicated to instruction at the graduate
level and research by graduate students and faculty in the Department of
Economics. This work concentrates on new developments in computationally
intensive econometrics.

EML is a unit of the Institute of Business and Economic Research, located
in space provided by the Department of Economics at the University of
California, Berkeley.
